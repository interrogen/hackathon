## Required Reading - and Viewing

### Basics of APIs

[An Intro to APIs](https://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/an-intro-to-apis) - good overview that introduces not only APIs but also several closely related technologies like web services and JSON (you can find a resource for JSON in the section, *Related Technologies*).

[APIs 101: What Exactly is an API?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpRcK4GS068) - a YouTube video series produced by ProgrammableWeb which offer concise and clear explanations about everything related to APIs. Both Part 1 and Part 2 are worth viewing.

### REST APIs:

RESTful APIs are a particular category of APIs that follow very strict format and are quite popular for using external services. *REST* is an acronym which stands for *REpresentational State Transfer*. The following resources provide a great foundation for using this technology.

[REST API & RESTful Web Services Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LooL6_chvN4) - fairly long video but should be viewed before accessing any of the other resources. It presents a thorough explanation of REST services using basic coding examples.

[RESTful Web Services Tutorial with Example](https://www.guru99.com/restful-web-services.html) -example of calling APIs through Microsoft’s .NET framework

[What is REST API – A comprehensive Guide to RESTful APIs](https://www.edureka.co/blog/what-is-rest-api/) - This is a great general tutorial which uses the node.js framework. More info about node.js is given in the *Related Technologies* section.

### Design considerations

[How to design a REST API](https://restfulapi.net/rest-api-design-tutorial-with-example/) - explanation about naming conventions and API data models.

Furthermore, APIs are defined using an OpenAPI standard also known as a *swagger* file. It includes the details of how a particular API works and the data elements that it shares. Whether you write APIs r you just use them, being familiar with their details is quite useful.

[Create Your First OpenAPI Definition with Swagger Editor](https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/create-your-first-openapi-definition-with-swagger-editor/) is a great tutorial to learn more about this specification:

### JSON
 APIs send data using structured messages such as XML or JSON. Therefore, it is a good idea to have a strong understanding of JSON.

 >JSON stands for *JavaScript Object Notation* which is a lightweight data format structure that is often used in web applications because the data can be read and parsed using JavaScript.

[The Complete JSON Tutorial - Quickly Learn JSON](https://www.codewall.co.uk/the-complete-json-tutorial-quickly-learn-json/) - offers a great overview of the JSON object, including data types and formatting.

[How to Learn JSON Absolute Beginner Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltElhGVXXa4) -  very thorough video course that covers all aspects of JSON including how to use it in web development. It is very lengthy (47 minutes).
