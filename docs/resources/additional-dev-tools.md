## Additional Development Tools

Developing applications to incorporate APIs requires a complete development environment. Because many applications are written in JavaScript, it is possible to write all of the code in a text editor. However, it is often beneficial to have an environment that can check the syntax of the code, manage multiple files within a single project and run test.

### Text Editors

[Atom.io](https://atom.io/) - fully customizable text editor which was released by GitHub. (It's free!).

- [Getting Started with Atom](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/f1-text-editors) provides step-by-step instructions for installing Atom.

- [Atom Basics](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/) is a great tutorial within the Atom documentation.  

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - is a feature-rich text editor that has been very popular for years (It's a commercial product but you can use it for free).

- [Sublime Text Basics: All the Best Features in One Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIkg3Oo1PVM) - 15 minute video that will get you familiar with many cool features.


There are a lot of other text editors on the market:

### Swagger editor
[Swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) – A syntax-specific editor to create API specifications (useful for writing APIs)

### Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
These are the programming environments for writing actual code which is essential if you are going to create an application.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - one of the best source code editor available as it supports a wide variety of languages, has a rich community of plugins and works for Windows, Mac and Linux. It offers a built-in terminal window so that you can run your code directly from within the IDE.

Visual Studio Code was developed by Windows and released as open source (Free!)

- [Introductory Videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) - large collection of additional instructional tutorials

[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) - another popular open source IDE. Eclipse is extremely extensible and supports multiple languages.

[CodeAnywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/) - an online IDE that requires no installation.

### Managing source code

Git is the ubiquitious open source standard for managing code today and is ideal for accessing files at such large public repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/). First, you will need to have git installed on your computer. It is freely available for [download](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Testing

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a great tool to test connections to APIs and ensure that the desired data is being returned. You can also share test cases with other people.

### Databases

It is not necessary to have a database to consume APIs. When writing an API, however, it is usually important to have a storage mechanism for keeping data. Often these data are kept in JSON format which are documents.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) – the most popular open database for JSON objects
