### Using the APIs - API Keys
In order utilize the APIs that are exposed through the developer portal, you will need to obtain an **API key**. This is a unique key code generated for you and will be used to authentication when calling a secure API.

The process for obtaining a key involves the creation of a project on the portal (which will generate an API key). Then, you link your project to other APIs which basically provisions them to your account.

#### Creating a project {#creating}

The process for creating a project is done through the API products which are accessible from the title bar.

Select *View* next to the project that you want to see.
